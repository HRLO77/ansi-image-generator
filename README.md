# ansi-image-generator

An ANSI image generator, to start it run:
`python generator.py`
Then enter an image path and additional arguments.(--resize resizes the image to 300x300, --reduce reduces the quality)

The generator doesn't support custom resizing or reducing values, I'm probably going to add them in the future.

You can add them yourself if you want.
